# Question of Life

Over the last few weeks, I've been looking inward to discover the central question that drives my interests and career-related decisions. Currently, I've come up with this: **How can we best leverage technology and law to maximize well-being in a sustainable and equitable fashion?** 

This Question of Life is too hefty to tackle on its own, so I focused on its central word, "well-being." Many decisionmakers, researchers, and philosophers operate under this assumption: If well-being ought to be maximized, there should be a way to measure it. But if there is no objective way to do so, then **Why and how do we quantify value of human life? How does this change depending on our social position?** 

### Where It Began

I was on my daily evening stroll with my parents, passing by our neighbor's work-in-progress house, when we started talking about how impoverished Chinese peasants view old family members with illness. My dad's distant uncle, recently diagnosed with terminal illness, would not receive treatment; his son 就等他死—was waiting for him to die. Just a week later, my mom skipped dinner to make a series of international calls. My grandpa's lung cancer was showing signs of recurrence. Treatment would be $20,000 USD a year. On the phone with my grandmother, my mom was adamant about paying it, even if it would only extend my grandpa's life by two years. 

I can understand how someone might criticize either side. How can someone watch a loved one die without even trying to stop it? How can someone lay down $20,000 a year to extend a life already full of suffering? Money comes with the privilege of rearranging your priorities—the mere possibility of life becomes invaluable. I wouldn't say my mom *intrinsically* values my grandpa's life more than my dad's cousin values his father's, even though she was willing to spend far more money to cover treatment costs (*monetary* value). Therefore, one issue with assigning money to human life is that the relative value of money for someone is partially dependent on their socioeconomic status. 

Moreover, we are terrible at predicting our own behaviors. The price we would be willing to pay to treat a sick relative likely differs in a hypothetical versus real scenario. Our assessment of human value depends on our vested interest and emotions—which brings up yet another flurry of intricate topics, such as the race to garner empathy for social justice movements, or the securitization of various threats.

Since the value of life is not objective, then instead of comparing value across people quantitatively, perhaps an ordinal model is more appropriate. In the ordinal utility of economics, consumers rank choices according to subjective preferences rather than absolute magnitudes. While utility is usually applied to commodities, we could take the idea of subjective value and analyze the factors that shape those preferences. For instance, instead of asking, "how much does my mom value my grandpa's life?," the better question is "what factors contribute to how we value human life?" Therefore, the conclusion we should reach from the differences in my mom versus my dad's cousin's decisions is not "my mom values my grandpa's life more," but rather, "a baseline of wealth allows people to make decisions that increase well-being."

*Sidenote #1: I think ordinal utility is an interesting model for making choices that align with our values and interests. Googling "what are the best jobs?" is not very useful because it does not consider the subjective weight we put on various abstract and material factors; we can really only compare our level of fulfillment to our own current or past levels (this would explain the rise of self help).*

*Sidenote #2: We can also discover our own values through utility. I was conflicted as to whether I was Enneagram Type 1 ("the moral perfectionist") or Type 3 ("the successful achiever") and by analyzing an important choice I made in high school, I realized I get more utility from morality than from success.* 

### Two Mindsets

Inevitably, well-being raises questions of efficiency. Establishing a baseline of financial security, while perhaps would increase well-being, is not so economically efficient. Moves to make well-being more equitable and accessible generally cause [deadweight loss](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadweightloss.asp#:~:text=A%20deadweight%20loss%20is%20a,an%20inefficient%20allocation%20of%20resources.)—and though economics teachers caution against viewing deadweight loss as inherently undesirable, the term itself holds a negative connotation, implying an unfair tradeoff between undeserving beneficiaries and wronged losers. 

Despite so much contemporary hype around adopting an abundance mindset, scarcity still permeates the social sciences. In high school, my teachers instilled the [idea](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Politics_Who_Gets_What_When_How/UlekDwAAQBAJ?hl=en) that politics is "Who Gets What, When, and How." The introductory international relations course I took last year began with theories of structural realism and anarchy posited by ancient white cis-gendered males. The pandemic, which requires international collaboration and immense selflessness to tackle, has made me question the sustainability of this mindset.

[https://irispengs.github.io/googletrends/](https://irispengs.github.io/googletrends/)

And yet, I can't help but wonder how a scarcity mindset might be useful or even necessary on a societal or global scale. The graphic below categorizes the ideas of resource depletion and unfairness as a scarce worldview. First, I think it is more accurate to label resource depletion and unfairness as real *consequences* of policymakers, corporations, and governments operating with scarcity mindsets. But if the illustrator is right and the very notions of resource depletion and unfairness come from a scarce worldview, then it is a necessary instance of a scarcity mindset. This is not pessimism; it is realism: natural resources are finite and unevenly distributed. Shifting to an abundance mindset for *initial decision-making* (as opposed to analyzing the consequences of societal and global issues) **is the first step needed to resolve these issues. 

![Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled.png](Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled.png)

![Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled%201.png](Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled%201.png)

However, I have two concerns with separating mindsets into these two opposing categories. First, its difficult to differentiate abundance and scarcity. For instance, self help books like *How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dale Carnegie is less about how to form real friendships, more about how to network for financial and personal gain. Carnegie offers guidelines such as not criticizing others, expressing appreciation for them, and seeing from their perspective. On the surface, these suggestions reflect abundance, but the underlying goals—increase your earning power, increase your prestige, make you a better salesman, etc—are somewhat manipulative. I’m also worried that the abundance mindset could be used by the rich to promote the “anyone can make it” narrative. Unfortunately, adopting an abundance mindset isn't uniformly easy. Those who have experienced structural inequalities like poverty are naturally more skeptical of promises of improvement and have [decreased](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/30/poverty-negative-spiral-fear-self-loathing) confidence levels. 

On the opposite extreme resides the problem of [choice overload,](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/choice-overload-bias/) in which people are overwhelmed by the abundance of options to choose from. Choice overload mostly refers to consumer decision-making in the age of hyperconsumerism, which in itself is unsustainable. But because choice overload is largely a first-world problem, I want to shift to another type of abundance paralysis: empathy fatigue. 

### The Psychological Limits of Doing Good

A lot of literature exists surrounding compassion fatigue, which the Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project defines as "a broadly defined concept that can include emotional, physical, and spiritual distress in those providing care to another. It is associated with caregiving where people or animals are experiencing significant emotional or physical pain and suffering." But Dr. Tania Singer argues that compassion fatigue is a misnomer; the true cause of distress is *empathy fatigue.* While we can feel empathy for both positive and negative feelings, compassion is [associated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6005077/) with positive feelings of "warmth, concern, and care for the other, as well as a strong motivation to improve the other’s wellbeing." 

![Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled%202.png](Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled%202.png)

Empathy fatigue is usually applied to counselors, healthcare workers, and other caregivers. But when various atrocities are constantly circulating on the news and media—in part due to sensationalism as an editorial tactic and empathy as a political tactic—the scope of empathy fatigue is spreading. According to Richard F. Mollica and Thomas Hübl:

> Millions of people turn to their phones and devices for daily notifications of traumatic news. These instantaneous alerts offer little space for digestion and reflection. That harmful combination of speed and trauma can strike at our nervous systems, overwhelming us until we are too numb to comprehend the complex range of experiences flooding in over the last days, weeks, and years. What happens to us as a culture, grappling with this cumulative phenomenon?

> Where collective trauma now exists, we need to seek ways to facilitate dialogue and restoration. The numbness following traumatization reduces our capacity to witness suffering. We lose our reflective capacity to be self-aware, which reduces empathy and compassion. Indifference and disconnection can contribute to further atrocities, fueling a feedback loop that makes new traumas more likely to occur.

A closely related concept is the psychological phenomenon of [psychic numbing](https://www.arithmeticofcompassion.org/psychic-numbing). According to Paul Slovic, a lead researcher on the phenomenon, our brains are not designed to think on the levels of millions or billions, so when tragedies are framed in such large scales, our apathy actually increases. On the other hand, individual stories cases can more effectively compel action, as in the case of a photograph of a drowned Syrian boy on a beach, which prompted a flood of donations toward efforts mitigating the Syrian refugee crisis.

![Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled%203.png](Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled%203.png)

### Should we change our decision-making framework to move *away* from numbers, or build a system that can *better grasp* them?

The project Arithmetic of Compassion, of which Paul Slovic is a contributing editor, highlights two other psychological obstacles to effective compassionate decision-making. [Pseudoinefficacy](https://www.arithmeticofcompassion.org/pseudoinefficacy) is "the idea that people are less willing to help one person when they are made aware of the broader scope of people in need that they are not helping." [The prominence effect](https://www.arithmeticofcompassion.org/prominence) is "a theory of choice that says people often default to choosing the option that is better in the most prominent or defensible attribute."

These three obstacles have several implications for how we value human life. The first is that humans are bad at it. If we cannot grasp numbers well, we could shift away from them. Activists could employ more storytelling, or [narrative empathy](https://www.arithmeticofcompassion.org/environmental-humanities/#narrative-empathy)—but again, this could increase the circulation of victimization narratives and push people toward empathy fatigue. The Arithmetic of Compassion also suggests that activists tie explications of social issues to *action* *options* for people to take. 

At the same time, the project advocates for interpreting numbers in a different way. To overcome pseudoinefficacy, the benefits of prosocial actions should be framed in *collective* and *aggregated levels*, across many people in a relatively short period of time, say a day or a week (also known as the [Collective Aggregation Effect](https://www.arithmeticofcompassion.org/blog/2019/5/29/overcoming-pseudoinefficacy-with-the-collective-aggregation-effect)). Moreover, we should recognize that "even partial solutions save whole lives." Instead of getting caught up in percentages, the project [argues](https://www.vox.com/explainers/2017/7/19/15925506/psychic-numbing-paul-slovic-apathy) that we should think about "the reality that these numbers [of lives saved] represent." For instance, if we can save 4,500 lives in a refugee camp, we should regardless of whether the camp has 11,000 people or 250,000. 

There are even people who believe we can automate compassion by programming machines to make moral decisions. In a 2017 interview with Vox, Slovic [pondered](https://www.vox.com/explainers/2017/7/19/15925506/psychic-numbing-paul-slovic-apathy), "What should be the value of a life? If we find that humans are inappropriately devaluing life, maybe these program values would be better." Already, we see the emergence of platforms that [use](https://oneconcern.com/en/platform/) artificial intelligence and machine learning to visualize disaster risk, with the aim of improving "disaster resilience"—preparedness, response, and mitigation.

Though less technical, the Effective Altruism movement aims to steer compassion in a more logical, evidenced-based direction (read: automated). It suggests the following three-factor framework for choosing a cause to work on.

![Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled%204.png](Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled%204.png)

![Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled%205.png](Question%20of%20Life%201b4cba0e6770427e870ce1ed5493f6ac/Untitled%205.png)

- Great in *scale* (it affects many lives, by a great amount)
- Highly *neglected* (few other people are working on addressing the problem), and
- Highly *solvable* or *tractable* (additional resources will do a great deal to address it).

If you multiply these factors together, you get *amount of good done per extra person or dollar.* 

On the surface, this framework seems to have some tensions with the partial solutions idea to combat pseudoinefficacy proposed by thinkers at the Arithmetic of Compassion. However, I think one way to resolve this tension is that the partial solutions idea is a prerequisite mindset needed to work on *any* cause, whereas Effective Altruism framework is used by people to choose *between causes*. People must first believe they *can* make a difference. Then, they can choose *where* to make that difference.

80,000 hours is the leading Effective Altruism organization that gives advice on choosing high positive social impact careers. The organization [admits](https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/#advantages-and-disadvantages-of-quantitative-problem-prioritisation) that uncertainty is a major disadvantage to this quantitative problem prioritization approach: 

> In practice, these types of estimates usually involve very high levels of uncertainty. This means their results are not robust: different assumptions can greatly alter the conclusion of the analysis. As a result, there is a danger of being misled by an incomplete model, when it would have been better to go with a broader qualitative analysis, or simple common sense.

But on the organization's website, this is the only major downside listed. The qualitative factors they suggest when considering careers are centered around the individual, such as personal fit and career capital. In terms of actual problem prioritization, they don't grapple with more difficult ethical considerations, such as how future lives compare to current lives.

### What Yardsticks Don't Measure

80,000 hours primarily calculates scale in terms of "yardsticks" that they believe correlate with long-run social impact, such as reduction in the risk of human extinction, amount of global economic output raised, and the number of quality-adjusted life-years saved. Unsurprisingly, Nick Bostrom is widely cited by the organization and other Effective Altruists. His Question of Life, ''What should one do if one wants to have the greatest expected positive effect on the world?' is similar to mine. His answer largely centers around his beliefs on existential risk:

> Existential risks have a cluster of features that make it useful to identify them as a special category: the extreme magnitude of the harm that would come from an existential disaster; the futility of the trial-and-error approach; the lack of evolved biological and cultural coping methods; the fact that existential risk dilution is a global public good; the shared stakeholdership of all future generations; the international nature of many of the required countermeasures; the necessarily highly speculative and multidisciplinary nature of the topic; the subtle and diverse methodological problems involved in assessing the probability of existential risks; and the comparative neglect of the whole area.

I want to highlight *future generations, highly speculative nature,* and *comparative neglect*. The first indicates large scale, but only if you consider the value of future generations as equal to that of the current generation. Future generations is a common argument used to promote climate change mitigation strategies—and yet, there is a certain level of privilege to considering the future. Similar to how wealth changes our perceptions of abundance and scarcity, the future generation argument means we believe we have a collective future. Meanwhile, many of the world's least privileged communities are plagued by present suffering, always uncertain about the possibility of their current existence. Therefore, a comprehensive decision-making framework must consider how suffering compounds. 

Take climate justice. Many global initiatives and organizations on climate justice argue that climate change disproportionally [affects](https://www-jstor-org.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/stable/pdf/10.7864/j.ctt6wpgcq.3.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A5642f30a8e5f30edf02b32f211d054dc) the poor, and thus we "[must](https://www-jstor-org.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/stable/pdf/10.7864/j.ctt6wpgcq.18.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A5642f30a8e5f30edf02b32f211d054dc) address climate change...to reverse the harm faced today by the poorest communities on the planet." By contrast, the authors of a paper published by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs [argue](https://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2017/wp152_2017.pdf) that this framing presents inequality "as an afterthought." They instead propose a "unifying conceptual framework" that characterizes the relationship between climate change and social inequality as a vicious cycle "whereby initial inequality makes disadvantaged groups suffer disproportionately from the adverse effects of climate change, resulting in greater subsequent inequality." Under this framework, it is possible to address the UN's Sustainable Development Goals for inequality reduction (SDG-10) and climate action (SDG-13) simultaneously. Nonetheless, the authors prioritize inequality reduction, as it could not only contain climate change, but mitigate it. 

Bostrom believes that the highly speculative nature of existential risk is a reason to increase our attention to mitigating it. For many, COVID-19 epitomizes this argument, and the virus's unknown origin is a reason to crack down on the lab leak theory—even if some justifications for it are grounded in [Sinophobia](https://www.eurasiareview.com/03062021-lab-leak-theory-and-anti-china-mania-oped/) and one of its main proponents is a [promoter](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/06/07/wade-j07.html) of racist pseudoscience. Unfortunately, as a consequence of initial decision-making grounded in scarcity (i.e. vaccine hoarding), resources to combat the pandemic are finite. The effort and money we spend on chasing the theory trades off with the aim for global vaccine equity. With this example, we see two gray areas with utilitarianism: the goal of saving lives and maximizing well-being can lead to some *morally questionable methods or assumptions* and *focusing on highly speculative topics could trade off with combating known inequities*.

Comparative neglect operates similarly. Lesson learned from the United States' response to COVID-19: The U.S.'s previous oversight and inexperience with pandemics has resulted in mass suffering, so we funnel millions of dollars toward hunting down the other zoonotic pathogens and sources of existential risk. Meanwhile, two million children [die](https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/fh-mediacloud/2017/02/Poverty_Fact_Sheet.pdf](https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/fh-mediacloud/2017/02/Poverty_Fact_Sheet.pdf) every year from preventable diseases, their lives just a statistic we've already grown numb to. 

My Question of Life, like Bostrom's, is highly influenced by utilitarianism. But I'd like to think that in emphasizing the importance of sustainability and equity, my exploration will properly factor in present-day suffering and minimize immoral assumptions and processes. 

### Concluding Thoughts

Back to the original question: **Why and how do we quantify value of human life? How does this change depending on our social position?**

- People quantify the value of human life because they believe it leads to better, more objective decision-making. It aids in cost-benefit analysis on all scales: personal (career choices and hospital bills), national (pandemic response), international (climate change and poverty), etc.
- We generally quantify the value of human life in either monetary or temporal terms (including the number of lives or number of years of life saved), but the weights we give on various factors changes depending on social factors such as wealth and our vested interests.
- The amount of wealth we have influences how individuals perceive scarcity. (True equity, however, requires *initial* decision-making—mainly by people in positions of power—with an abundance mindset.)

From this, another question: **Should we change our decision-making framework to move *away* from numbers, or build a system that can *better grasp* them?** 

- We must consider efficacy; does quantifying the value of human life actually lead to better decision-making?
- The Arithmetic of Compassion believes that quantifying human life is not always effective because humans have trouble grasping the reality of numbers. But there are ways to mitigate this problem: narrative empathy, presenting action options, the Collective Aggregation Effect,  recognizing the merits of partial solutions, and machine learning.
- Effective Altruism, which takes a utilitarian approach in how to help others, would argue that quantifying the value of human life, while not perfect, would lead to net better decision-making, as they believe these numbers correlate with long-run social impact.
- But as demonstrated by Bostrom's writing on existential risk, there are several moral issues that arise from how we approach quantifying human life. Emphasis on future generations, high speculation, and comparative neglect could lead to the abandonment of current suffering populations.

And touching on my Question of Life: **How can we best leverage technology and law to maximize well-being in a sustainable and equitable fashion?** 

- First, we need **better decision-making frameworks that consider the moral dilemmas, psychological limits, and inconsistencies** in measuring the value of human life. Thus, I believe we should quantify the value of human life, but not for a purely utilitarian outcome. A system that can better grasp the value of human life must **empower moral decisions grounded in equity and sustainability**. **Narrative empathy**—when used strategically, without victimizing the less privileged and fostering compassion instead of empathy fatigue—**and machine learning are complements** to this process. The intended outcome of these frameworks would be to put people in a state that **minimizes their scarcity mindset** when making personal decisions, perhaps guided by [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html).
